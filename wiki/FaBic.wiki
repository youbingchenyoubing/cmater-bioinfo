To run windows executable fabic, we have to execute it in following ways: 

fabic inputfile outputfile mnr mnc threshold

where, 
	i)  inputfile is path of input file.
	ii) outputfile is path of output file.
	iii)mnr is minimum number of row. Datatype is integer 
	iv) mnc is minimum number of col. Datatype is integer
	v)  threshold is value of threshold used to binarize the given matrix. Datatype is real number(float)
	
Input file contains a 2D matrix infollowing format (a,b are any real number values).

		b,b,b,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,b,b,a
		b,a,b,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,b,a,b,a,a

In output file, 1st line shows Bicluster number 'bc#:',
		2nd line shows column number 'c:', 
		3rd line shows row number 'r:' and
		4th line shows total number of columns and rows in that bicluster and so on ....
